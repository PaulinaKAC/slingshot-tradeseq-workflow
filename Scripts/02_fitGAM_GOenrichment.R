# ============================
# 5. Lineage 2 analysis
# ============================
#
# NOTE:
# The analysis for Lineage 2 is written in the *exact same structure*
# as for Lineage 1 (steps 4.1 â†’ 4.6).
# This deliberate symmetry ensures:
#   - Reproducibility: results are directly comparable across lineages.
#   - Maintainability: if more lineages are added later, the same
#     modular layout can be reused.
# Perform the same steps as in chapter 4 by adjusting the lineage. 

# ============================
# 6. Summary & outputs
# ============================
#
# At this point, the pipeline has completed:
#   - Fitting GAMs for Lineage 1 and Lineage 2
#   - Identifying dynamic genes with start-vs-end tests
#   - Running GO enrichment on significant genes
#   - Performing per-cluster enrichment analyses
#   - Generating heatmaps (log1p and z-score) of GO terms
#
# Outputs were written to:
#   - results/  â†’ R objects (.rds) and tables (.csv)
#   - plots/    â†’ Heatmaps (.pdf)
#
# This consistent structure allows results from Lineage 1 and Lineage 2
# to be compared directly and makes the workflow easy to extend to
# additional lineages if required.

# --- Optional: print a message to console ---
message("All analyses complete. Results are in 'results/' and plots in 'plots/'.")

# --- Optional: save session information for reproducibility ---
