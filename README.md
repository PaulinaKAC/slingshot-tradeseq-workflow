# slingshot-tradeseq-workflow
This repository contains an R-based workflow for pseudotime and trajectory inference on single-cell RNA-seq data. It starts from a processed Seurat object and uses Slingshot for lineage detection and pseudotime estimation, followed by tradeSeq for differential expression along trajectories.
